## Shared contribution principles

- Keep changes focused and small.
- Add tests for behavior changes.
- Keep docs in sync with API/CLI changes.
- Prefer backward-compatible updates unless a breaking change is planned and documented.
- Use `npm` as the contributor package manager to match `package-lock.json` and npm-based scripts.
- After cloning, install git hooks with `npm run hooks:install` when the repository provides this script.
