title: Key Features
---

This page explains the main capabilities of susee and why they matter for library package workflows. Each feature is designed to keep TypeScript package builds simple, predictable, and publish-ready.

## TypeScript-first build flow

Susee is built around TypeScript library development, not application bundling. It compiles your package source while preserving a package-oriented workflow, including declaration output for consumers and clean library artifacts.

## Dual output support

Susee can produce both ESM and CommonJS outputs from the same entry definition. This helps you ship packages that work smoothly with modern import-based environments and older require-based ecosystems at the same time.

## Automatic duplicate symbol handling

When source consolidation produces conflicting declarations, susee can automatically rename duplicates. This reduces manual cleanup work and helps prevent collisions that would otherwise break build output.

## Fast, low-overhead builds

Susee focuses on the library use case, so the build pipeline avoids unnecessary app-level complexity. The result is a leaner build cycle that fits package development and release workflows.

## Package metadata update support

Susee can update relevant package metadata after build output is generated. This makes it easier to keep published package fields aligned with what was actually built.

## Plugin extension points

You can extend build behavior through plugins to fit project-specific requirements. This gives you flexibility for custom processing without replacing your whole build toolchain.

For plugin categories, execution order, and implementation examples, see [Plugin Types and Lifecycle](/guide/plugin-types-lifecycle).

## CLI and programmatic API

Susee supports both command-line usage and direct integration through its build API. Use the CLI for local development and CI commands, or call the API when you need custom scripting and orchestration.

## Why these features matter

Together, these features make susee a strong choice for TypeScript library maintainers who want reliable outputs, broad module compatibility, and a straightforward path from source code to npm-ready packages.
